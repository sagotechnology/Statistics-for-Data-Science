For checkup $i$, let $W_i$ be the event that the patient is well, $I_i$ be the event that the patient is ill, and $D_i$ be the event that the patient is dead.  Transitions can be modeled as a set of conditional probabilities.  For example the probability that a patient that is well in checkup $i$ is well at the next checkup is, $P(W_{i+1}|W_i)$.\n",
